	<p>
	   The names of all environment variables added by this plugin are prefixed with this string.
	   Since the reserved Node name is always injected this field is required. 
	</p>
	<p>
		e.g.: default "DB" prefix will produce this environment variable name
		<pre>
            DB_NODE_NAME or DB_SETTING_1
		</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Environment variables defined here will be made available to every build executed by this agent,
		and will override any environment variables that have the same Name . 
    </p>
    <p>
        Using the syntax $NAME or ${NAME} (%NAME% on Windows), these variables can be used in job 
        configurations, or from process launched by a build.
